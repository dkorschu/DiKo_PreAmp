  Includes the bachelor’s thesis in which the preamplifier was developed.  

- **Blockdiagram/**  
  Contains the block diagram of the preamplifier.  

- **Pictures/**  
  Photos of the preamplifier prototype.  

- **Software/**  
  Source code for both the microcontroller firmware and the desktop application used to control the digital potentiometers.  

## Status  

- Initial release of design files and documentation.  
- Known circuit errors in the **Altium/** project (to be listed in detail soon).
