# DiKo_PreAmp

This repository contains all resources related to the design, development, and documentation of an audio preamplifier that was created as part of a bachelor’s thesis. The preamplifier includes a crossover network whose transmission characteristics can be adjusted using digital potentiometers.

## Repository Structure  

- **3D_Print/**  
  Contains 3D print files for the PCB mounting bracket.  

- **Altium/**  
  Altium Designer project of the preamplifier, including schematics and Gerber files.  
  Note: The current design contains electrical errors. These will be documented and fixed in an upcoming update.  

- **Bachelor_Thesis/**  
  Includes the bachelor’s thesis in which the preamplifier was developed.  

- **Blockdiagram/**  
  Contains the block diagram of the preamplifier.  

- **Pictures/**  
  Photos of the preamplifier prototype.  

- **Software/**  
  Source code for both the microcontroller firmware and the desktop application used to control the digital potentiometers.
  The microcontroller was programmed using the Arduino IDE and the desktop application was developed in C# with Microsoft Visual    Studio. 

## Status  

- Initial release of design files and documentation.  
- Known circuit errors in the **Altium/** project (to be listed in detail soon).
